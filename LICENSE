CREDITS AND ATTRIBUTION
--------------------------------------------

This project does not use any external datasets, pretrained models,
or third-party copyrighted text. All analysis and rewrite logic is
implemented manually in `src/services/analysis.py` using custom heuristics.

All UI code (`src/web/index.html`) and backend logic (`app.py`) were written
entirely by William Sutton for educational purposes in the UVA
Final Systems Project.

No additional attributions are required.
